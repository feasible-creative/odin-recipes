<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            4 Large Bell Peppers
        </li>
        
        <li>
            1 LB Lean Ground Beef
        </li>

        <li>
            1 Cup Cooked Rice
        </li>

        <li>
            1 Can (15oz) Organic Tomato Sauce
        </li>

        <li>
            1 Cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
        </li>




    </ul>


    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pre-Heat oven to 375Â°F.
        </li>

        <li>
            
            Cut thin slice from stem end of each bell pepper to remove top of pepper. Remove seeds and membranes; rinse peppers. If necessary, cut thin slice from bottom of each pepper so they stand up straight. In 4-quart Dutch oven, add enough water to cover peppers. Heat to boiling; add peppers. Cook about 2 minutes; drain.
        </li>

        <li>
            In 10-inch skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is brown; drain. Stir in rice, salt, garlic and 1 cup of the tomato sauce; cook until hot.
        </li>



        <li>
            Stuff peppers with beef mixture. Stand peppers upright in ungreased 8-inch square glass baking dish. Pour remaining tomato sauce over peppers.

        </li>


        <li>
            Cover tightly with foil. Bake 10 minutes. Uncover and bake about 15 minutes longer or until peppers are tender. Sprinkle with cheese.
        </li>

       

       


    </ol>
